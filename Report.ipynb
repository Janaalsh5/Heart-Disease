        "Heart disease is one of the most common and life-threatening conditions worldwide, causing millions of deaths each year. The major challenge is that many people develop serious heart problems before they are even aware of their risk. Traditional medical check-ups may not always detect early warning signs, making prevention and early detection extremely important.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we aim to solve the problem of identifying individuals who are at high risk of heart disease using data analysis and machine learning. By analyzing key health indicators such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels, we can build a predictive model that classifies whether a person is likely to develop heart disease. This can help healthcare providers take early action and guide patients toward healthier lifestyles or medical treatments before the disease becomes severe.\n",
        "\n",
        "We believe this problem is important because early detection can save lives. Predicting heart disease risk using data not only supports better medical decisions but also helps reduce healthcare costs, prevent hospitalizations, and improve overall public health. Addressing this issue through technology can contribute to a healthier and more sustainable society."

        "This study applies two essential data mining approaches classification and clustering to evaluate and understand the risk of heart disease. The classification technique focuses on building a predictive model that determines whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on various medical attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and other health indicators. The goal of this model is to accurately classify patients into two categories: those with heart disease and those without it.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, clustering is used to group patients into meaningful clusters based on similarities in their health characteristics, without using the heart disease label. This unsupervised approach helps reveal hidden patterns, patient subgroups, and underlying risk profiles that may not be immediately visible through simple observation. By combining both classification and clustering, this study provides a deeper understanding of patient patterns and enhances the ability to identify and analyze risk factors associated with heart disease.\n",
