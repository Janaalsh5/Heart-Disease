# Heart-Disease
# Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing a heart disease dataset with 11 clinical features, such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and chest pain type. Our goal is to develop a classification model that identifies people at risk, enabling timely interventions. Additionally, clustering techniques will be applied to uncover hidden patterns or risk factors, offering deeper insights into cardiovascular health.

# Motivation

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection is critical since many deaths occur prematurely due to heart attacks and strokes. By applying machine learning methods, this project aims to support preventive care and medical decision-making, demonstrating how technology can play a vital role in reducing the global burden of heart disease.
